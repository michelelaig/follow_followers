# follow_followers



Just put account information in the script;
it will store followers in "profili.txt" in order to not ask too much times for the same list, in case of reiteration,
I plan on understanding how to use follow_users() instead of follow() in the days to come.
remember to have profili.txt and dio.py in the same folder
